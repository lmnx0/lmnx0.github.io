        <p>Jhonatan and Lester are bestfriends since they are elementary. They both went to the same school in 
            highschool and it is Notre Dame of Dadiangas University. The story starts when they were third 
            year in high school.</p>
        <p>Jhonatan woke up late because last night, his group mates are finishing the project for their science 
            subject which is a volcano model. It was 7:03am when he left and his mother's calling for him because
            he forgot his volcano model</p>
        <p>Jhonatan:Bye ma, I got to go now!</p>
        <p>Jessica: Jhonataaan! you forgot your project in the living room</p>
        <p>He went back to the living room and picked up the project he left and ran to school
            (Few minutes earlier at 6:17am. Lester is waiting for Jhonatan in front of the gate)</p>
        <p>Lester: why won't you reply to me Joohn!![in a furious tone] and if you don't see my message by 6:20am 
            I'll go ahead in classroom by my self.</p>
        <p>They both always go to their classroom together but today he didn't know that Jhonatan stayed up late.
            Its already 6:20am and Lester have no choice but to go now. On the way, Lester saw Jhonatan's group mate.</p>
        <p>Lester: hey Joice, do you know what time Jhonatan went home?</p>
        <p>Joice: I think he stayed up all night to finish the project</p>
        <p>Lester: oh I see, thankyou</p>
        <p>Lester and Joice then both went to their classroom. Later on, Jhonatan got to school at 7:40am</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: hello ma'am, hello classmate, I'm sorry I'm late</p>
        <p>Teacher: why are you late mr. Sabareto?</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: I'm sorry ma'am, I stayed up late for our project so I woke up late</p>
        <p>Teacher: Hmm okay, you may go to your seat now</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: Thank you ma'am</p>
        <p>Jhonatan sat in his chair, and suddenly, Lester whispered to him.</p>
        <p>Lester: John, I have some news</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: later, our teacher will get mad</p>
        <p>An hour later, first period of class finished. Jhonatan and Lester then talked to each other</p>
        <p>Lester: Joohn do you know the rumour?</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: no, what is it?</p>
        <p>Lester: someone has a crush on you</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: What!! Everyone knows it ?</p>
        <p>Lester: some of, but yeah kinda</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: I don't know who she is but I'm not interested</p>
        <p>Lester: come on, she is the top student of her class</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: not interested (in mind: because you are the one I'm interested on!) [he smiled]</p>
        <p>Lester: Then why are you smiling ?</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: nothing, I just remembered a funny moment about last night</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, their adviser greet them and discussed a lesson about physical education which
            is about sexuality</p>
        <p>Max: okay class, we are going to discuss about sexuality. Do you know that their are more than 7 
            gender including the LGBTQ community. So, does anyone have any idea what is LGBTQ community?</p>
        <p>Cypher Jabe is that smart student who's always the one to raise his hand in class, but unexpectedly,
            Jhonatan raised his hand too</p>
        <p>Max:Okay Jhonatan, go ahead</p>
        <p>Cypehr jabe: (in mind: hmm, why is he suddenly active in this class?)</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: LGBTQ community means that Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender queer community where 
            they have different gender, different identity of them selves and different attraction</p>
        <p>Max: That is correct. Thankyou mr.Sabareto, you may seat now</p>
        <p>Cypher jabe: (in mind: Oh it think he is interested in this discussion)</p>
        <p>Later on, the discussion's about to end, and Sir Max announces that they will be doing an activity to 
            present next week, which is role-playing about the LGBQ community. Lester, Jhonatan, and Cypher are 
            groupmates, and they plan to practice in their vacant time since Sir Max dismissed class early</p>
        <p>Cypher jabe: so my plan is that our roleplay will be about a daughter that came out as a lesbian. So, 
            who want be that character?</p>
        <p>Joice: me</p>
        <p>Cypher jabe: okay, who will be her father ?</p>
        <p>Lester: me</p>
        <p>Cypehr jabe: and the mother?</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: (in mind: me HAHAHA)</p>
        <p>Cypher jabe: (in mind: hmm why he is laughing?)</p>
        <p>Other member: me</p>
        <p>Cypher jabe:Okay, who will be Joice's bf that she don't want to be in a relationship with?</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: me</p>
        <p>Cypher jabe: now, who will be the gf that want to be in a relationship with her? Oh, that would be you</p>
        <p>Other member (2): okay HAHHSHS I don't have any other choice anyways</p>
        <p>After class, Lester and Jhonatan went to the gym to play their sports which is volleyball and 
            it starts at 10am</p>
        <p>Lester: Hey Jhonatan, that is the girl that has a crush on you</p>
        <p>Jhonatan:Oh she is ugly tho</p>
        <p>Lester: whaaat ?!!! Bro, is your eyes okay? Because I think you should get it checked</p>
        <p>Johnatan: My eyes are perfectly fine, and I can even clearly see my future with you [murmurs]</p>
        <p>Lester: what did you say?</p>
        <p>Johnatan: ahh nothing [blushes]</p>
        <p>They went home after class. Suddenly, someone sent a chat to Johnathan and it's Samantha Cabiles.
            It was 8pm.</p>
        <p>(TEXT CONVERSATION)</p>
        <p>Samantha: Hi, i saw you at the gym. Your game was great and got my attention of your beauty 
            {insert blushing emoji} (message to Jhonatan)</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: wait Samantha texted me</p>
        <p>Lester: how do you know her fb account?</p>
        <p>Jhonatan: she just messaged me and I just saw it in archive now</p>
        <p>Lester: ohhh so what are you waiting for? reply her</p>
        <p>Johnatan: (in mind: why would I, you're the only one I would reply to HAHHA)</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Okay, I'll do it just to let her know I noticed</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Hi Samantha, I'm sorry but I'm more focused on my studies (reply to Samantha)</p>
        <p>Samantha: it's okay, I understand that since I also focus on my studies, but at the same time
            I'm focused on you too {insert smirk emoji}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: your funny HAHAHAH so I heard that you are the top of your class?</p>
        <p>Samantha: yees, are interested too?</p>
        <p>Johnatan: sorry but no</p>
        <p>Samantha: it's okay, I'll wait for you</p>
        <p>(END OF TEXT CONVERSATION)</p>
        <p>The next day. Samantha walked towards Johnatan</p>
        <p>Samantha: heeey!! Johnataann! {waves while smiling}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: oh no</p>
        <p>Lester: oohh Joohn, here she comes {smiling}</p>
        <p>Samantha: Good morning Johnathan!, how are you?</p>
        <p>Johnatan: (in mind: uncomfortable because you're here)</p>
        <p>Johnatan: oh me, I'm fine</p>
        <p>Jasmine: Lester, lets go to the canteen, my treat</p>
        <p>Lester: okay lezzgoo, have fun HAHAHAH, bye samantha</p>

        <p>Samantha: are you sure its my discussion??</p>
        <p>Johnatan: yees (in mind: even though i don't want to)</p>
        <p>Samantha: okay, let's go to the gym</p>
        <p>They then went to the gym and talked about their academics</p>
        <p>Samantha: so are you more into volleyball or me?? {giggling}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: (in mind: what iww)</p>
        <p>Johnatan: ahhh HAHAHAH just volleyball</p>
        <p>Samantha: Oh I see</p>
        <p>Johnatan: (in mind: I hope you can see that i have no interest in girls)</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Lester and Jasmine talk about Johnatan and Samantha while eating in the cafeteria</p>
        <p>Jasmine: so do you know about them?</p>
        <p>Lester : wait, are they engage???!!!</p>
        <p>Jasmine: Hope so HAHAAHHAA</p>
        <p>Lester: HAHAHA yeah but I want to share something</p>
        <p>Jasmine: about what?</p>
        <p>Lester: Samantha</p>
        <p>Jasmine: what is it ?</p>
        <p>Lester: well you know, I have crush on her</p>
        <p>Jasmine: WHAAAT?! then why are you helping Johnatan to be with her?</p>
        <p>Lester: because last night, I texted her</p>
        <p>(THE TEXT)</p>
        <p>Lester: Hi Samantha, are you free tomorrow?</p>
        <p>Samantha: ahh yeah, by the way, are you that close friend of Johnatan?</p>
        <p>Lester: yeah, why?</p>
        <p>Samantha: I actually have a crush on him and I'm hoping you would help me {insert blushing emoji}</p>
        <p>(END OF TEXTING)</p>
        <p>Lester: at that time, I was shattered and hurt. I want to express my feelings for her, but I 
            also want to see her happy, so I'm helping her be with someone she loves, which is not me</p>
        <p>Jasmine: ohh I'm sorry, I didn't know that you have feelings for her</p>
        <p>Lester: it's okay, I just hope that she will be happy with my bestfriend {forced smile}</p>
        <p>Jasmine comforted Lester and did not tell her friend Samantha about it. In the gym, 
            Johnatan and Samantha played volleyball. Johnatan intends to hurt Samantha.</p>
        <p>Samantha: ahh you're really serious about this HAHAHHA</p>
        <p>Johnatan: yeah I sure am</p>
        <p>Samantha: okay then, do it</p>
        <p>Johnatan: okay here I goo</p>
        <p>Johnatan served nicely, and Samantha passed. Then Johnatan spikes it hard and directs it at Samantha.</p>
        <p>Samantha: whoa that was intense HAHAHA</p>
        <p>Johnatan: yes it was {grinning}</p>
        <p>He repeated the action until Samantha was injured in the shoulder.</p>
        <p>Samantha: oh no it was too fast... ooww</p>
        <p>Johnatan: oh sorry for that</p>
        <p>Johnatan didn't mean it when he said sorry. They kept going until Samantha got hurt in the head</p>
        <p>Samantha: wait noo ... Aaaaahh!!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: oh sorry again, I didn't meant to</p>
        <p>Samantha: are you sure?!! Just say that I did something wrong!!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: what?</p>
        <p>Samantha: are you kidding mee?!! You are doing this on purpose!!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: what, no</p>
        <p>Samantha: then why are you hurting me PHYSICALLY!!!! {tears are starting to come out}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: okay, I will say it. The truth is, I'm not interested in girls. I'm into boys, and 
            I have feelings for Lester.I don't know what to say to you because it may seem awkward to me 
            and you will be curious if I don't want to say why I don't like you back. I apologize and 
            hope you will forgive me.</p>
        <p>Samantha was shocked and ran away. Unknowingly, Lester heard all of it.</p>
        <p>And that next day, Samantha and Johnatan had no interaction or communication with each other.
            Lester also kept avoiding Johnatan because of what he heard.</p>
        <p>Two weeks have passed, and Johnathan has decided to pursue talking to Lester</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Lester, waait!</p>
        <p>Lester: {not saying anything}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Lesteer, please why do you keep avoiding me ? Did I do anything wrong to you?</p>
        <p>Lester: {looks away and still not saying anything}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: so you're just going to leave me like this?!? {shouting}</p>
        <p>Lester grabbed Johnatan and took him to a private place after he shouted that it got everyone's attention.</p>
        <p>Lester: I ... Heard ... Everything {angry}</p>
        <p>Johnatan: about what?</p>
        <p>Lester: I'm not dumb!!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: I don't know what you're talking about?!</p>
        <p>Lester: about Samanthaaa!!!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Lester let me explain {shocked}</p>
        <p>Lester: what will you explain ??? I heard everything !!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: why are you so mad? is it because I'm into you???!!!</p>
        <p>Lester: no.... It's because you hurt her.. I gave her to you, and you just hurt her!!</p>
        <p>Johnatan: so her feelings matter more than mine?! you're bestfriend??!</p>
        <p>Lester: yeees !!!! because I have feelings for her, and I gave those up to let her be happy with you</p>
        <p>Johnatan: I had no idea you had feelings for her because you never told me... {crying}</p>
        <p>Lester: JOHNAATAAN, I don't always share my secrets with you because I have boundaries, even though we 
            are bestfriend.... You know what.. I don't want to talk about this anymore..</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Lester..</p>
        <p>Lester left, and Johnatan continued to cry while shouting Lester's name.</p>
        <p>Some days later, Johnatan messaged Samantha to apologize and they met privately</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Hi Samantha, I'm realy sorry again for all I've done</p>
        <p>Samantha: it's okay, atleast now I know</p>
        <p>Jonathan: I regret a lot of things..</p>
        <p>Samantha: I can tell, that is why I brought someone that you want to say that to</p>
        <p>Lester showed up and Johnatan was shocked</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Lester, I'm sorry</p>
        <p>Samantha gave them privacy, and Lester sat beside Johnatan</p>
        <p>Johnatan: I'm sorry again Lester. I know that I was horrible, selfish, rude and I regret my actions.
            I hope you forgive me. I just ..... I don't ....... I just don't want to lose you..</p>
        <p>Johnatan cried and Lester hugged him</p>
        <p>Lester: I understand now and I accept your feelings, so from now on, no more secrets, okay?</p>
        <p>Johnatan: Thankyou .... I will .... No more secret {smiling}</p>
        <p>Lester wiped away Johnatan's tears, and they hugged each other again. On the other hand, 
            Samantha heard everything and smiled. Suddenly, someone called her, saying that she dropped something</p>
        <p>Unknown person: ahmm excuse me, I think you dropped this {smiling}</p>
        <p>Samantha: ahhh... Yeahh thank you, by the way, are you new here ?</p>
        <p>Unknown person: ahmm yes but do you know where is the admin here ?</p>
        <p>Samantha: haha yeah, it's on the second floor</p>

        <p>Samantha: haha your funny but yeah i can show you the way, just follow me.</p>
        <p>Unknown person: Thank you Ms.?</p>
        <p>Samantha: Samantha Cabiles, and you?</p>
        <p>Jessie : I'm Jessie Ibaskes</p>
        <p>Time has passed, they both started getting closer, and at the end, they both ended up in a relationship. 
            They went to the cinema on their first date together.</p>
        <p>Samantha: you are so beautiful, Jessie</p>
        <p>Jessie: and you are always beautiful too, my Samantha. Thankyou for accepting me lovely</p>
        <p>Samantha: well I got help from a friend</p>
        <p>Jessie: oh I hope to meet him soon </p>
        <p>Samantha: yeah soon </p>
        <p>They both held each others hand and watched the movie together</p>
        <p>And both couples live happily ever after.</p>
