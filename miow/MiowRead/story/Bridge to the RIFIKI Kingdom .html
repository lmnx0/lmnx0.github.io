        <p>Shalyn: here we are the kingdom of RIFIKI </p>
        <p>Jacob (mind): uhh this is just a forest</p>
        <p>Shalyn: I'll show you the way to the castle </p>
        <p>Shalyn:That house is where the leopardion live they kinda vegetarian</p>
        <p>Shalyn: and that mashroom that where the elvis live ,they knda like meat so much that is why their teeth are sharp </p>
        <p>Elvis: smile (show some thei sharp teeth) </p>
        <p>Jacob : awkward smile ( because he only see mashroom) </p>
        <p>Shalyn: And that is gorgavo the giant tree, he protect the small creator in the forest </p>
        <p>Shalyn: HIII GARGAVOO! nice to see you agian ! </p>

        <p>Shalyn: here we are the castle of RIFIKI</p>
        <p>Jacob: confused ( because he only see a tree house ) </p>

        <p>At that time jacob are so confused maybe Shalyn just imagine things that it's not real  
        Jacob say that its all just her imagination</p>

        <p>Shalyn: come eat this bread this from the bakers of RIFIKI  and they say this is the best bread in this place </p>
        <p>Jacob (take the bread and say ): Shalyn this all just in your imagination I think I only see is forest and just a tree house </p>
        <p>Shalyn:OHHH thats the thing you have imagine thing so you will see it </p>

        <p>Jacob: what? how ? I dont know if we have the same imagining of them? </p>
        <p>Shalyn: it's not about how we both imagine it is about how you believe that you see it</p> 
        <p>Jacob: confused ( that he don't understand ) </p>
        <p>Shalyn: just like this just imagine and believe that someone aprouch their that he wanted to buy some fruits </p>
        <p>Jacob imagine and still not believe that theirs someone in thier but eventually a batigs attacking the kingodm and jacob feel thay the air something that it is flying like flying how the bath attacking them and the batig is when they drom some of their feather it is an explosion </p>

        <p>Shalyn: jacob ruuun the batigs are attacking us </p>
        <p>Jacob( see nothing but feel that something was attacking them ): I still have no vision of the creator but why their is explosion over this forest ? </p> 
        <p>Shalyn: it because that is their feather only to defeat them is gave a nut of the forest wich we go to gargavo to help us</p>

        <p>They both went to the giant tree called gargavo and need help to the castle</p> 
        <p>Shalyn: gargavo we need a nut of the forest the batigs attacking us again. </p>
