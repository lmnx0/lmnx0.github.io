    <div id="container">
        <p>There was a girl who lost her eyesight when she was 11 and she hated herself for it. She hated everyone, 
            except her loving boyfriend. He’s always there for her. One day, her boyfriend proposed to her. </p>
        <p>“Will you marry me?” He asked while holding her hand</p>
        <p>“I would marry you only if I could see the world again.” She replied while pushing his hand away</p>
        <p>A week later, they found a donor. The operation took place and she got her eyesight back. Later on, her 
            boyfriend reached the hospital.</p>
        <p>“Will you marry me now?” He asked</p>
        <p>The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was also blind and immediately refused him. Her 
            boyfriend forced a smile and walked away. She then saw a letter in the table and tears in her eyes 
            started to come out as she read it.</p>
        <p>“I thank you for the beautiful days that we spent together. Please take care of my eyes, sweetheart.”</p>
        <p>THE END</p>
