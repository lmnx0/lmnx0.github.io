    <div>
        <p>There’s a Japanese man named Koichi. He is very tall, handsome, rich, has a porcelain skin, and travelling 
            around the world is what he loves to do. He is also every girl’s dream man. He can captivate anyone by 
            his appearance. Anyone would say that he is perfect but, there's one thing that people don't know about 
            him.</p>
        <p>One day Koichi received a message from a group chat but ignored it. An hour later his assistant Ms. 
            Hitomi knocked at his door and said “Sir, your friend Foster is here” Koichi replied “let him in”.</p>
        <p>Foster started talking about Tsubaki who found a forest called Aokigahara and they want to have a 
            vacation in there. Koichi is kinda interested in going with them.</p>
        <p>“Ms. Hitomi, do I have any appointment tomorrow?” Koichi asked</p>
        <p>“Yes sir, at 8am to 11am” Ms. Hitomi replied in a respectful tone</p>
        <p>“Okay, I'll see you all tomorrow in there” Koichi said</p>
        <p>“Wooohoo! You’re the best bro!” Foster said while jumping in joy</p>
        <p>Foster then waved goodbye to Koichi and went home. The next day after Koichi's meeting, they all 
            headed to the forest. At the destination, they all got off Koichi’s van.</p>
        <p>“Finally, we’re here!” Tsubaki said while smiling cutely</p>
        <p>“Interesting place” Kio said</p>
        <p>Sakura and Haruto started to look around.</p>
        <p>“Haruto-kun! Take a picture of me” Sakura said</p>
        <p>“Smile, sweetheart” Haruto replied while taking a picture of Sakura</p>
        <p>Koichi and Foster are both building the tent while smiling.</p>
        <p>“It’s almost night time” Koichi said while looking at the sky</p>
        <p>“Yeah, we should start cooking” Foster replied while looking at Koichi</p>
        <p>All of them sat circularly near the bonfire and started telling scary stories.</p>
        <p>“By the way did you guys know that this forest is where a lot of people died” Tsubaki said while pointing 
            the flashlight on her face</p>
        <p>“Ugh stop lying Tsubaki!” Sakura replied and stood up with a shaky legs</p>
        <p>They all started laughing while Tsubaki looks serious. Sakura went inside her tent and her boyfriend
            Haruto followed her.</p>
        <p>“We should sleep, it’s very late now” Foster said while yawning</p>
        <p>They all went to sleep. But not actually all of them. Sakura and Haruto silently started walking away 
            from the tent and they’re heading to the Fugaku wind cave. Unknowingly, they are being followed by 
            someone.</p>
        <p>“What a perfect timing” An unknown person said while grinning from afar</p>
        <p>“That’s the cave! oh finally” Sakura said while smiling</p>
        <p>“Finally huh~” Haruto said while smirking</p>
        <p>They both went inside the cave and started kissing and touching each other. They were too distracted 
            that they didn’t hear someone walking towards them.</p>
        <p>“Having fun?” An unknown person said while sharpening a knife.</p>
        <p>Sakura and Haruto stopped and they both look terrified.</p>
        <p>“W-what do you want!?” Sakura said while her tears are starting to come out</p>
        <p>“Is that- is that a knife!?” Haruto said while protecting Sakura</p>
        <p>“Tsk. How lame, y’all always say that” The unknown person replied while getting closer to Haruto</p>
        <p>“Isn’t it obvious? Someone’s gonna die, so, who’s going first?” The unknown person pointed the knife to 
            Haruto’s face</p>
        <p>Haruto hugged Sakura while begging the unknown man to kill him instead and let her beloved girl live.</p>
        <p>“Like hell I’d do that, my target is the one who made my Himari suffer, am I right? Sa-ku-ra” The 
            unknown person started laughing like a psycho and slowly removed his mask</p>
        <p>The man behind the mask is Koichi. Sakura is petrified while Haruto is shocked as if he had seen a ghost. 
            Koichi told them both to stab themselves if they wanted an easy death. Haruto knows that he can't fight 
            back, so he kissed Sakura for the last time and stabbed himself. On the other hand, Sakura didn’t 
            stab herself.</p>
        <p>“No.. I still want to live.. I didn’t mean to! PLEASE LET ME GO!” Sakura shouted while kneeling and 
            begging for her life</p>
        <p>“You’re in the same position like Himari when she was begging for you to stop, how.. HOW DOES IT 
            FEEL?!” Koichi shouted and grabbed Sakura’s hair</p>
        <p>“You made my Himari suffer everyday at school. She begged you to stop but you never did. Do you know 
            what’s worse? You saw her getting touched by Kio but never did anything! AND YOU EVEN LAUGHED” 
            Koichi said with a deadly stare</p>
        <p>“I DON’T CARE, I DON’T REMEMBER, SHE DESERVES TO DI-“ Sakura’s last word before Koichi slit her 
            throat wide open</p>
        <p>“After all, it’s only Haruto who loved you for real while you were just using him, do you really think you 
            deserve to live?” Koichi said while grabbing one more knife out</p>
        <p>Koichi started slicing Sakura’s face until it looks like it can barely be recognized anymore. He then
            started pulling both corpse and he’s heading to the Saiko Lake to throw the bodies in there. He tied both 
            bodies together and threw it in the lake.</p>
        <p>“There you go lovebirds, now you two will be together forever, in hell” Koichi said with a smile while 
            walking away</p>
        <p>He went back to where their tent was in. He went to his tent to get his bag which is actually full of 
            weapons. He brought the bag with him and slowly opened Kio’s tent.</p>
        <p>“One more body and I'll finally be able to avenge your death, Aishiteru.. Himari (I love you.. Himari)” 
            Koichi said while taking a hammer out</p>
        <p>Kio opened his eyes and saw Koichi covered in blood. Before he could even shout, Koichi hit his head 
            with a hammer that made a very big hole in his head. He then used a lot of different weapons on Kio’s 
            dead body. After that, he went back to his tent and didn't bother cleaning himself.</p>
        <p>“Himari.. I have avenged you” Koichi said before he fell asleep</p>
        <p>In the morning. Tsubaki woke up first and went to Kio’s tent to wake him up.</p>
        <p>“Kio wake up, cook us something, I’m-“ Tsubaki couldn’t continue what she wanted to say because of 
            what she’s seeing</p>
        <p>She saw Kio’s body scattered all over the tent. Kio’s eye is hanged up above the tent and his head is in the 
            pillow while the rest of the body are just scattered everywhere. Tsubaki is horrified and she turned pale. 
            She slowly backed away and tripped. She could not believe she saw such a brutal thing.</p>
        <p>“N-no..no. AHHHH” Tsubaki screamed which made Foster and Koichi wake up</p>
        <p>“Tsubaki it’s too early, why are you screaming?” Foster asked Tsubaki while yawning</p>
        <p>Tsubaki pointed at Kio’s tent. Foster saw what happened to Kio and was also horrified. Koichi then came 
            out of his tent.</p>
        <p>“K..Koichi you.. blood-“ Foster said while backing away</p>
        <p>“Dang. I messed up, I got too excited” Koichi said while grabbing a hammer</p>
        <p>Foster saw a gun inside Kio’s tent and took it. He pointed the gun at Koichi. Foster also told Tsubaki to 
            run and she slowly got up while shaking.</p>
        <p>“No, don’t be scared , we can talk this out, I have my reasons!” Koichi said while walking towards Foster</p>
        <p>“ONE MORE STEP AND I’LL SHOOT KOICHI” Foster replied with a serious look</p>
        <p>“Listen, Foster, I'm not going to hurt you, just hear me out” Koichi said while staying still</p>
        <p>“NO, IT'S CLEAR TO ME WHAT YOU JUST DID, YOU'RE A MURDERER!” Foster replied while backing away</p>
        <p>“THEY DESERVED IT OKAY? JUST LET ME EXPLAIN FIRST” Koichi shouted while taking a step forward</p>
        <p>“DON'T YOU DARE MOVE KOICHI, I SWEAR I WILL SHOOT YOU” Foster shouted and pointed the gun at Koichi's Head</p>
        <p>“THEY MADE MY HIMARI SUFFER, THEY DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE” Koichi shouted with a furious expression</p>
        <p>Koichi took one more step so Foster shoot him without any hesitation. Koichi fell into the ground and 
            started bleeding. Foster was so petrified that he was unable to comprehend the situation.</p>
        <p>“Himari.. we will be able to see each other.. now.” Koichi’s last words before he closed his eyes</p>
        <p>Koichi's vision was blurry. When it started getting clear, he realized that he's in a hospital. His girl
            Himari is sitting while sleeping besides him.</p>
        <p>“Himari you're alive! I was so scared.. please don't ever leave me” Koichi said while patting Himari and 
            crying</p>
        <p>Himari was confused but she brushed it off because she was too happy that Koichi finally woke up. Koichi 
            then sighed heavily and was happy that it was all just a dream</p>
        <p>(But was it actually just a dream? Or a taste of the future?)</p>
        <p>TO BE CONTINUED..?</p>
